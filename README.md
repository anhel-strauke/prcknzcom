pirockinez.com sources
======================

Repo for sources of pirockinez.com. It was never intended to be forked. I just use this repo to synchronize 
changes between different computers and to back up the code base. You're wellcome to use this code if you want, 
but there is no rocket science or any amazing features.

Things I use:

* Python 3.4
* Django
* MySQL (or Sqlite)
